    <p>
        You know, it's rather fascinating to witness how Google diligently records our interactions with phones and computers. Now, I won't divulge any confidential details, of course. But it serves as a stark reminder of the comprehensive manner in which our digital actions are meticulously monitored and archived.

    <h2>Other things the instructor should know about me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm originally from Punjab, India. My family consists of just my mother and me. What really gets under my skin are disorganization, shortcuts, impatience, unprofessionalism, and lies. I firmly believe in taking responsibility for my own actions instead of blaming circumstances.
