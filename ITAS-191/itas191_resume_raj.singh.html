        <h2>Google History</h2>
        <p>
            It's quite interesting to see how Google keeps track of our activities on our phones and computers. I can't share any confidential details, but it's a clear reminder of how closely our digital actions are observed and stored.
        </p>
        <h2>Other things the instructor should know about me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm originally from Punjab, India. My family consists of just my mother and me. What really gets under my skin are disorganization, shortcuts, impatience, unprofessionalism, and lies. I firmly believe in taking responsibility for my own actions instead of blaming circumstances.
