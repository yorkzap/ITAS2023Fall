# ITAS-181 Class Notes

## Best Practices

1. **Use Tab Completion for File Access**: When navigating and interacting with files, consider using tab completion to avoid issues like running a file with an incorrect extension. For example, if you have a file named `brandon.dat.txt`, typing `br` and then pressing Tab can help you complete the file name correctly, preventing errors caused by hidden extensions added by some systems (e.g., Windows).

2. **Name Directories with Capital Letters**: To make it easier to distinguish directories from files, adopt the practice of naming directories with capital letters or using consistent naming conventions. This helps improve directory organization and clarity within your file system.
