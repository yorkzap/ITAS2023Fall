Assignment 02: Wordle Game
Description:
    This WordleGame class simulates the popular word guessing game 'Wordle'. The 
    game selects a secret five-letter word which the player must guess within a 
    limited number of attempts. Each guess provides feedback to the player in the 
    form of colored letters: green for correct letters in the correct position, 
    yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and uncolored for incorrect 
    letters. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly 
    or runs out of attempts, at which point the game can be restarted.
