# ITAS 185 - Introduction to Programming: Lab 9 Exceptions

This repository contains two interactive Python programs developed for ITAS 185 - Introduction to Programming, demonstrating exception handling and user interaction.

## Overview

The project includes two main Python scripts:

- `guess.py`: A number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected number, with input validation and error handling.
- `users_choice.py`: A utility that counts the frequency of a specified letter in text files, demonstrating file handling and custom exception usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended for dependency management).

### Setting Up the Project
