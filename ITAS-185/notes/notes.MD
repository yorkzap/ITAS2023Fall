## What is programming?

- **Definition:** Programming is the art, science, and engineering of designing and writing computer programs.

## What is a program?

- **Definition:** A program is a set of instructions that directs the computer's behavior.

## What is Python?

- **Definition:**
    - High-level, general-purpose programming language.
    - Easy to read, dynamically typed, and garbage-collected.
    - Supports multiple paradigms.
    - Comprehensive standard library ("batteries included").

## Different Kinds of Languages

- **Programming Language (High-Level Language):** 
  - Use human-readable code.
  - Requires a compiler or interpreter for execution.
  
- **Machine Language:**
  - Consists of binary and coded commands.
  - Understood by the computer as 0's and 1's.
  
- **Assembly Language:**
  - Uses symbolic instructions (mnemonics) to represent machine code.
  - More human-readable than machine language.
  - Requires an assembler for translation into machine code.

## CPU (Central Processing Unit)

- The CPU is at the heart of the computer.
- It fetches, decodes, and executes instructions to produce results.
- Internally, it consists of two parts:
  - Control Unit
  - Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
- The CPU performs the fetch/decode/execute cycle to process program information.
  - **Fetch:** Retrieve the next instruction.
  - **Decode:** Interpret the instruction.
  - **Execute:** Perform the operation specified by the instruction.
