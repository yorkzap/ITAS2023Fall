## The Journey Begins

This repository is a chronicle of my academic and practical odyssey as I 
embark on the ITAS program at Vancouver Island University. It's a window 
into the courses I've embarked upon, the assignments and projects I'm 
commanding, and the intricate details of my quest in the realms of IT and 
web development.

## Semester & Classes

Here, you'll dive into the courses I'm mastering during the Fall 2023 
semester. Each course is a cosmic adventure, filled with learning 
experiences, celestial challenges, and the stars of knowledge.

- **ITAS 185 - Introduction to Programming Concepts:** Instructor: Allan 
McDonald
- **ITAS 167 - Applied Operating Systems:** Instructor: Brandon Britt
- **ITAS 191 - Introduction to Web Design:** Instructor: Bill Dou

## Missions (Assignments)

This sector is dedicated to my missions - the assignments I undertake 
throughout the semester. It's a log of my progress, solutions, and the 
cosmic insights I gather as I navigate these assignments. Each directory 
is named after its corresponding class code, containing the assignments 
and related information. Furthermore, every step of each assignment is git 
committed, offering a transparent view of each update and challenge 
encountered along the way.

## Exploring New Frontiers (Projects)

This sector contains all the finished projects I build with the help of 
instructors. This will be a showcase of completed web apps. You'll 
discover the projects I'm pioneering as part of the ITAS program. These 
projects are my spacecraft for creativity, and here, I'll unveil 
descriptions, code artifacts, and real-time updates on the development 
voyage.
